## `Foreword`

-This repository is by no means intended to be a ripoff, clone, carbon copy of, etc...
Where credit is earned, credit is given.
And for the source material that pertains to this repository - credit is due.

  -In my opinion, there is no better 'entry-level' computer programming teacher IN THE WORLDthan my friend, Mr. Mosh Hamedani. He has earned every bit of the credit and accolades he's received online - whether that be from his peers, his own personaal mentors, or even his students around the world: He's the real deal.
],
**[
  -I feel compelled to prefix this README file with credidation, not only because he's an
  honest man trying to make an honest living - which I fully respect and would
  never minimize. But also because, I wish I had a follow-along for this course. The
  number of times I would flip back and forth from visual-studio-code to firefox is, to
  be honest, quite massive. So, I feel like a guide like this is somewhat necessary.
],
**[
  -Currently, I'm in the process of obtaining permission from the man himself, Mosh, to
  officially credit this as being the course's 'official follow-along guide'.
  Official or not, the intended purpose of this repository will never change. Even if this
  only help ONE individual on their path to success, I've done what I came to do.

**[
  -As a teacher, a leader, and a role model for the entirety of the human race, my good pal Mosh Hamedani should be celebrated.
