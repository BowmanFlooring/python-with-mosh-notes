The Python language boasts a 'batteries included' feature set. This esentially
means that it comes with common modules/features/packages that we need when
building real-world applications.

In this section, here's what we will learn.

1. Working with FILES/DIRECTORIES
2. SQLite DATABASES
3. Date/Time OBJECTS
4. Generating RANDOM VALUES
5. Send EMAILS
   etc., etc., etc....

When working through this section, it is advised NOT to actually memorize
anything. Just try to get an idea of what is where, and what you can do. This
section can basically be used as a reference, or a guide, when it comes to
these topics. :)
