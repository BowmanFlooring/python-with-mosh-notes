# Functions (a reusable piece of code to perform a specific task)

# Python has built-in, reusable, functions
# Ex:
course = "Python Programming"
len(course)  # **
# ** the 'len' func. outputs the num. of chars. in 'course'
# our var., 'course', is given to the func. as an *argument*
# some fuctions require arguments (inputs of the function)

# if you want to index a certain character, or range of
# characters within a string, use '[]', like:
print(course[3])
print(course[-1])
print(course[0:4])
print(course[:4])
print(course[0:])
print(course[:])
