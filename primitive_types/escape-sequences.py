# Escape Sequences

# In Python, the 'escape character' is a backslash (\).
# It can be combined with a few other characters as listed:
"""
\",
\', 
\\, 
\n (new line)
"""

# The backslash is the escape *character*, and when used before a
# character (chars. listed above) that usually performs a simple
# function, it enables the use of the actual char. instead.
#   - the exception is '\n' <-- this means "new line"
